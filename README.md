This repository will be serving the purpose of documenting my path towards syslib enlightenment during the Spring 2024 semester, hence my name for this repository.

## About Me
I am a lifelong Louisvillian currently enrolled in UK's Library Science Master's program, and am on track to graduate in **Fall 2024**, which I just now realized is next semester!

Besides being a grad student, I also work full time at a branch in the Louisville Free Public Library as an Adult Services/Reference Library Assistant. Before enrolling at UK, I graduated from U of L with my BA in Philosophy and two minors: one in Chemistry and the other in German. I am attracted to Library Science because I feel that it is an area of study that rewards eclectic and broad academic interest while also allowing me to eschew becoming a specialist.

In case you were curious, here is what I look like:

The poor lighting is due to my having no overhead lights in my apartment, which is annoying sometimes, but more often than not, it suits me just fine.

### A few of my favorite things. . .
- Book: Probably either [*The Dispossessed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed) by Ursula K. Le Guin or [*Slaughterhouse-Five*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse-Five) by Kurt Vonnegut, though really those two are just my favorite authors and everything I've read by them is good. I also enjoy Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman, and Octavia Butler.
- Album: [*Perfect from Now On*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnU-2R4ohiE&list=PLC80P4gsPr-a5eQwzI8AgiNufehMQL5wP) by Built to spill, but I grew up on *The Beatles* and have a deep, abiding love for 60s and 70s music. The 90s, though, is where my heart lies when it comes to music, movies, and art/aesthetics in general. I'm always listening to something when I work, though it's usually soundtracks or ambient music (Brian Eno was my most listened artist in 2023).
- Film: Either [*The Big Lebowski*](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/115-the-big-lebowski?language=en-US) or [*The Lord of the Rings Trilogy*](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/120-the-lord-of-the-rings-the-fellowship-of-the-ring?language=en-US). I do a movie night with my friends, where we each rotate picking the movie, and my last pick was [*The City of Lost Children*](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/902-la-cit-des-enfants-perdus?language=en-US), an endearing and bizarre French steampunk fantasy film from 1995, directed by the guy who directed [*Amelie*](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/194-le-fabuleux-destin-d-amelie-poulain?language=en-US). It was highly enjoyable and I recommend it.
- TV Show: I don't watch much TV, but [*The Good Place*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Place) is probably my favorite live action show. I don't have an unnerring affinity for anime, but there are a couple that are very near and dear to my heart, namely [*Mush-shi*](https://myanimelist.net/anime/457/Mushishi) and [*Tatami Galaxy*](https://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei?q=tatami%20&cat=anime)
- Video Game: I have several at the top of my list: [*Bloodborne*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodborne), [*Hollow Knight*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Knight), [*Outer Wilds*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Wilds), [*Disco Elysium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Elysium), [*Tunic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunic_(video_game)), [*Persona 5*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_5), and [*Hyper Light Drifter*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Light_Drifter). With the exception of *Disco Elysium* and *Persona 5*, it should be evident from my list that I really dig games that manage to convey their narrative with as little written or spoken dialogue as possible, with HLD being the extreme case of this as it possesses no words at all over the story.
- Food: Caribbean cuisine is probably my favorite, though nearly any type of curry is going to be in contention for my favorite dish.
- Hobbies: Playing guitar and writing tunes, reading, running, tree identification, video games

## Outro
That should do it for an introduction! If you read through everything, then hopefully I was able to effectively convey a little bit more about myself and be interesting in the process. I really just wanted to use this as a way to experiment with some Markdown's basic syntax, and I think it was a worthwhile exercise in that regard.
