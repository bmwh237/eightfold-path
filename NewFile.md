# This is a test of the nano text editor

I am testing to see whether it will follow 
the commands from md. For example,
**will this be bold?** Or *this italicized?*

## Will this text be formatted as header like it would  in md?
- When I use the dash do I make a list?
- That's what I'm trying to find out now
- Hopefully this doesn't look stupid

[ ] I will leave this box unchecked,
[x] but not this one!

## This will be my closing section
