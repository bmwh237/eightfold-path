## Install Koha

It would seem that this week represents the final week that requires installation of software on our virtual machine, 
and in that sense it is a momentous one. There was much to work to be done on my end, so without any further ado let's
jump in to what was required of me.

This week installed the Koha ILS which give our nascent barebones ILS structure and life.

### Step 1: New G-Cloud Instance
The current "micro" G-Cloud instance that we've been using so far this semester is too small to handle everything that 
Koha requires of it, thus a new instance with more memory was necessitated. To do this, a new instance `ubuntu-koha`
was created and assigned the "medium" Machine Type which provides 4 GB memory as opposed to just 1 GB.

An ILS is interesting because it encompasses both a patron-facing component (the OPAC) and a staff-facing component 
(everything else), and in order to assure that important information doesn't use the wrong channels, a Firewall rule
needs to be made that specifies which virtual port packets of information being transmitted internally will use. Since
our  virtual instance uses HTTP, that would normally mean that everything goes through port 80, but in the settings on
the G-Cloud a special rule had to be made to open up port 8080 for internal use on the server.

By opening up the port in this step, we are allowed to tell our Apache server to "listen" to 8080 once we've installed 
Koha in Step 4 and are ready to configure it. This requires going into the ports configuration document and adding in
some instructions:
```
## Open up the config file
nano /etc/apache2/ports.conf

## Instruct the server to listen to the open channel 8080
Listen 8080

## Ensure that changes are valid
apachectl configtest
```

### Step 2: Install Koha Repository
Since we're booting up this VM instance for the first time, some boiler plate updating and unstalling are required in
order to ensure that our instance's usage of space is optimized. Of note for this step is the need to install `gnupg2`
to ensure secure communication on the server.

From here, everything we do has restricted permissions to the root user, so to avoid having to type `sudo` for every 
command and getting frustrated when I forget to do that for the fiftieth time, I simply use `sudo su` to become the
root user for my instance.

In order to add the Koha repository server, a familiar string of piped commands is required:
```
## Add the Koha repo to server
echo 'deb http://debian.koha-community.org/koha stable main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/koha.list

## Add the digital signature that verifies the repo
wget -q -O- https://debian.koha-community.org/koha/gpg.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```
The first time I attempted this, I forgot to become the root user, and so when I tried to update my VM to prepare it 
to install Koha, there was an error. I quickly figured out what was wrong, deleted the original document created by 
the `tee` command, and retyped everything as the root user encountering a smooth process from here on out.

### Step 3: Install Koha
This is a fairly straightforward albeit lengthy process as there are many files that must be downloaded for Koha to 
function. The name of the Koha program is `koha-common` and after initiating an update, I installed Koha.

### Step 4: Configure Koha
The first thing we have to do with our freshly installed ILS is make sure that it uses the proper port to transmit
information. This requires going into the `.conf` file and changing `INTRAPORT="80"` to `INTRAPORT="8080`.

Next, we instal MySQL server, set it up in much the same way as we did in module 4 and then enable URL rewriting 
and CGI functionality on our Apache2 server by using some `a2enmod` commands.

Following a restart of our server, we create our `bibliolib` database in in Koha, tell the server to listen to port
8080, and restart the server once again. The final step of configuration requires disabling Apache2's default setup,
enabling traffic compression, enabling the bibliolib site, and reloading everything once again.
```
## Disable the default Apache2 setup
a2dissite 000-default

## Enable traffic compression
a2enmod deflate

## Enable bibliolin website
a2ensite bibliolib

## Reload and restart the system
systemctl reload apache2
systemctl restart apache2
```
Thus the back end work is completed.

### Step 5: Koha Web Installer
The last step predominantly takes place in the web browser, but to finish configuring the settings for our ILS, we
need to retrieve the username and password for our ILS from the `koha-conf.xml` file. This information is located 
on lines 257 and 258 of that document.

Once we have that, we simply open up our ILS by going to the URL:
```
http://34.30.95.223:8080
```
And follow the steps to add options and permissions from there. Here are some examples of the optional choices I made
for my ILS:

That's all from me!
