# Notes on Creating a Barebones Cataloging Module

## Creating the HTML and PHP Files
Once again, I didn't have much time this week, so I simply copied 
the PHP and HTML code from `GitHub` and went from there. I did edit
the PHP code a little bit to make it say "here" instead of reading
out the whole URL on the successfully cataloged page.

## Security, Permissions, and Ownership
With regards to the authorization via the `htpasswd` command, the  
logic behind why we do it makes sense, but the steps I needed to 
follow felt a bit arcane, so I'm sure I will be visiting that page 
of the textbook repeatedly in order to figure out how to set up 
authentication in the future

It's a similar story with the permissions and ownership, I understand
why certain files need to have different owners and different permissions,
but the syntax isn't exactly the most intuitive and it still requires
a good deal of thinking for me to grasp what everything means

## Cataloging
I encountered no problems when using the cataloging module. I decided
to add some of the upcoming books for the book club I run at the library
and everything went quite smoothly.

## Conclusion
The practical elements of what we were doing and why for the cataloging module
make sense to me. However the syntax and theory dictating what's going on 
is quite a bit more confusing and I predict that it will take some time
for it to come naturally for me. That being said, this module was a great
reminder for how user-friendly GUIs are and how much time can be saved
when one implements a good, working module for entering information.
