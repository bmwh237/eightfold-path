# 5.1: Installing Wordpress
This week really feels like the beginning of the end. So far we've been working a lot behind the scenes
using the command line to create the bones of what will eventually become our ILS, but now, with the
installation of Wordpress, I'm starting to see how all the pieces are going to fit together. I'll break
down my week task by task

## Requirements
I hadn't updated my VM in a couple weeks and had actually initiated the `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade`
command before I started watching the video or reading the textbook for this week. I'm glad I did, because it
turns out my machine needed it. 

Anyway, the installation of the new `php` bits and the update of my `apache2` server went off without a hitch.

## Installing the Wordpress File
Once again, I encountered no difficulties here, and was incredibly mindful of what directory I was in throughout
my work this week. I would like to know what all the modifiers (`-xzvf-`) mean for the `tar` command, but that 
will have to be a question I answer when I have more time.

## Create the Database and a User
I was shocked that I didn't forget any 's or ;s when working with mysql, because I feel like I'm usually bound 
to mess up one of those at some point, but thankfully I didn't, so once again it was smooth sailing.

## Set up wp-config.php
A nice throwback to some of the first weeks of the course here using the `cp` command to ensure that the default 
still exists as a sort-of bk file in case we need to reconfigure everything later. I am curious what the "direct
FS_Method" entails exactly - just another thing to delve into later

## Change File Ownership 
Remembering the wisdom of last week:

>Directories where Apache needs to write data (like upload directories) or applications that need write access should be owned by www-data.

Makes the necessity to change ownership make a lot of sense. Though I do wonder if the `wp-config.php` file also
needs to be owned by **www-data** since the textbook mentioned config files needing to be readable by **www-data**,
but not writable. Maybe it doesn't matter for our purposes, though. All-in-all, my understanding of these "owners" 
feels firmer than last week, I think. Am I right to think that when **www-data** owns a file, that file can only be
edited with the `sudo` command/by a the root user? That seems to make sense and be consistent to me.

## Run the Install Script
Once again, I ran into no problems here. I made sure to keep my information on a txt file on my computer, which I 
know is not, strictly speaking, the most secure way to store it, but it is the most convenient.

I also changed the theme and altered the homepage of my Wordpress a bit, but I will be changing it next week and 
installing some themes. I plan on putting my IA acumen to use to make something good!
