# Documentation of the process of learning `git` 

## Week of 1/22/24: Module 2.2 - Using `git` and `GitHub` for Documentation
Initial set up of `GitHub` required 
three steps from me:
- [x] Create a `GitHub` repository
- [x] Create a file for documentation
- [x] Post a link to the repository
  on Canvas

## Week of 1/29/24: Module 3.1 - Learn the CLI
This week was all about practicing  
the Unix Command-line Interface (CLI)  
and learning the filesystem.
This is is what was required:
- [x] download and complete learn-the-cli program
- [x] download and complete learn-the-filesystem program
- [x] post screenshots to Canvas proving completion
- [x] OPTIONAL: run the flashcards program to familiarize self with commands

## Week of 2/5/24: Module 3.2 - Using the `nano` Text Editor
The focus of this week was on using text editors.
I was required to:
- [x] mess around with the `nano` text editor
- [x] create an md file in my `GitHub` repository  
      describing my experience with `nano` 
- [x] post a url linking my file on Canvas

## Week of 2/12/24: Module 3.3 - Searching with Grep
The new content covered this week invloved using the grep command   
to search operating-systems.csv. We also had to   
continue playing running the learn-the-cli and  
learn-the-filesystem programs to continue to improve  
our familiarity with basic Linux CLI commands.

Requirements for this week:
- [ ] use grep to search the operating-systems.csv and  
      copy the code block from the module page into `nano`  
      and save the file as **operating-systems.csv**  
- [ ] Download data from *Scopus* bib database and then use  
      the grep command to search that database  
- [ ] Create a new file in `GitHub` repository that displays  
      example grep queries and provides notes on interpretations  
      of the data contained in the *Scopus* databases  
- [ ] Post a link to the file on Canvas
