# Documentation of the process of learning `git` 

## Week of 1/22/24: Module 2.2 - Using `git` and `GitHub` for Documentation
Initial set up of `GitHub` required 
three steps from me:
- [x] Create a `GitHub` repository
- [x] Create a file for documentation
- [x] Post a link to the repository
  on Canvas

## Week of 1/29/24: Module 3.1 - Learn the CLI
This week was all about practicing  
the Unix Command-line Interface (CLI)  
and learning the filesystem.
This is is what was required:
- [x] download and complete learn-the-cli program
- [x] download and complete learn-the-filesystem program
- [x] post screenshots to Canvas proving completion
- [x] OPTIONAL: run the flashcards program to familiarize self with commands

## Week of 2/5/24: Module 3.2 - Using the `nano` Text Editor
The focus of this week was on using text editors.
I was required to:
- [x] mess around with the `nano` text editor
- [x] create an md file in my `GitHub` repository  
      describing my experience with `nano` 
- [x] post a url linking my file on Canvas

## Week of 2/12/24: Module 3.3 - Searching with Grep
The new content covered this week invloved using the grep command   
to search operating-systems.csv. We also had to   
continue playing running the learn-the-cli and  
learn-the-filesystem programs to continue to improve  
our familiarity with basic Linux CLI commands.

Requirements for this week:
- [x] use grep to search the operating-systems.csv and  
      copy the code block from the module page into `nano`  
      and save the file as **operating-systems.csv**  
- [x] Download data from *Scopus* bib database and then use  
      the grep command to search that database  
- [x] Create a new file in `GitHub` repository that displays  
      example grep queries and provides notes on interpretations  
      of the data contained in the *Scopus* databases  
- [x] Post a link to the file on Canvas

## Week of 2/19/24: Module 3.4 - Managing Software; 3.5 - Library Search
As a course of ingraining common commands into my frontal cortex,   
I'll once again be running the learn-the-cli and learn-the-filesystem programs.  
The new content covered this week relates to adding and subtracting   
software using the command line.

- [x] mess around with the sudo command by installing  
      some programs and examining the root (/) file systems.
- [x] mess around with the yaz-client to do some searching  
      for resources on the UK Library website
- [x] Document the result of my messing around in a new file  
      and upload it `GitHub`
- [x] Post a link to the new `GitHub` file on Canvas

## Week of 2/26/24: Modules 4.1->4.3 - Install and Setup a LAMP Stack
A lot to get through this week. I'll have to install and setup three different things
on my VM - Apache2, PHP, and MySQL. Now that we've hit the halfway point of the class
it makes sense that we'll be moving onto more complicated operations. Here's the 
to-do list for this week:
- [x] Install and set up Apache2 and create a web page (HTML  
      file)
- [x] Install and configure PHP and create index.php file,
- [x] Install MySQL, create a user profile, and a practice
      database
- [x] Successfully display the opac.php file in the browser  
      and submit a screenshot on Canvas
- [x] Submit link to notes and reflection to GitHub repo  
      on Canvas.

## Week of 3/4/24: Module 4.4 - Creating a Barebones OPAC
This week is meant to build on everything we set up last week. Having already set up
the web server, PHP, and MySQL, the goal of this week is to add to the OPAC database
in MySQL. Here's what needs to be done:
- [ ] Recreate the new PHP and HTML files from the Systems  
      Librarianship notebook
- [ ] Login to MySQL from Command Line and insert 5+ additional
      records. Play around with the new OPAC to make sure  
      everything is up-and-running
- [ ] Create a Markdown file in GitHub documenting my experience  
      with setting up and working with my OPAC
- [ ] Submit link to notes and reflection to GitHub repo
      on Canvas.
