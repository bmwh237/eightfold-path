# Notes on Installing a LAMP Stack
This week's task (or rather tasks) was a bit more involved than the first couple of weeks, as we were required to install
three programs on our virtual machine -- Apache2, PHP, and MySQL -- that will be necessary for creating oan operational
OPAC. In this write-up I'm going to talk about my experience installing and setting-up my LAMP stack 
(LAMP = **L**inux, **A**pache, **M**ySQL, **P**HP).

## Installing Apache2
The first task we were required to complete was instaling and setting up an Apache2 web server to eventually host our OPAC
database. I did not encounter any problems installing and setting up my web server, but I will say it was cool seeing what
goes on behind the scenes in uploading HTML pages to be hosted on a server.

For my HTML document, I decided to use my personal webpage that I had to make in my Foundations of IT class, and I love 
knowing that is hosted somewhere on the web now.

## Installing PHP
I didn't have trouble installing PHP either. I have never used PHP, so I will say that the syntax is a bit of a mystery 
to me, but I started to understand it a little bit better when typing up the MySQL PHP document. I did make a couple of
minor errors when typing out that document in `nano` that I didn't notice (because I forgot to run the `sudo php -f` 
command) but I figured that the issue of the file not displaying correctly was because of a syntax error, so I figured it
out pretty quickly.

As of right now, I don't know why we reconfigured the `dir.config` file to display PHP before HTML, but I'm sure it will
make sense once we start using Omeka and Wordpress.

## Installing MySQL
This was the section I feel like I learned the most from, and the one that made me most excited for what's to come next.
The biggest thing I'll have to remember when using MySQL is that commands don't end until you type `;`. Several times I 
forgot to place the semi-colon, and had to ^C out of the command to redo it. I'm sure I will screw this up several more
times befor the end of the course.

The syntax of MySQL made a lot more sense to me than PHP, and I found it to be very intuitive and user friendly.

## Conclusion
This was a much more intensive week than the previous weeks, but I also feel like I learned a ton. This week really gave
me a lot of perspective on how much I've learned. Sometimes when you're in the middle of learning, you don't have a good 
sense of how much knowledge you've gained, but I know for a fact that if you showed December 2023 Brian this week's 
assignment, I would have absolutely no idea where to start. The reality is that I was able to intuit what I was going to
have to do at many points, so that even if I didn't know the command ahead of time, I could follow along easily.
