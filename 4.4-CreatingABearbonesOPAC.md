# 4.4 - Creating a Barebones OPAC Write-Up

## Creating the Files and Searching
As I was a little bit strapped for time this week, I didn't retype these
files, but instead copied them onto into `nano` and paid attention to
what was in them so I knew what they were doing. Apparently I didn't pay
enough attention though, because when I initially searched my OPAC, I
tried to search without entering in a date range. Luckily, I realized 
a couple of failed searches what the likely issue was and discovered that
I was indeed correct. This was the source of my failed searches:

```
$query = "SELECT * FROM books WHERE
  (author LIKE '%$search%' OR
  title LIKE '%$search%' OR
  publisher LIKE '%$search%') AND
  copyright BETWEEN '$start_date' AND '$end_date'";
```

The `AND` connecting copyright to the parenthetical aspect of the `$query`
meant that I needed to provide a search term *AND* a date range and couldn't
simply provide the term by itself.

> NOTE: It is still possible to search with just a date range, however, since
  the lack of search term is not restrictive.

Interestingly, I think changing that Boolean to an OR wouldn't actually be
an elegant solution, since it would mean that you could look for a book that
has a relevant term, but then also return other results that don't contain 
that term. The solution would be to make the date range an optional search 
field, and I'm sure that would require creating some if...else statements.
I'll look into it more in the coming weeks, because I like the idea of having
some modularity in the search apparatus.

Other than that initial stumbling block, I had no issues creating the files
in the `/var/www/html/` directory and inserting my own IP address into the
files where it was required.

## Updating my MySQL Database
Adding new titles into my database was quite simple. I initially typed out my 
`insert` command into a Notepad, which saved me a lot of trouble later on since
I was able to simply copy and paste it into my Linux VM.

As far as what records to add, I decided to add the books that we've been
reading in the book club I run at my library. That amounted to seven titles, and
the command looked like this:

 ```
insert into books (author, title, publisher, copyright) values
('Cormac McCarthy', 'All the Pretty Horses', 'Alfred A. Knopf', '1992-05-11'),
('Colson Whitehead', 'The Underground Railroad', 'Doubleday', '2016-08-02'),
('Toni Morrison', 'Song of Solomon', 'Vintage', '1977-08-12'),
('Louise Erdrich', 'The Night Watchman', 'Harper', '2020-03-03'),
('Ursula K. Le Guin', 'The Left Hand of Darkness', 'Ace', '1969-03-01'),
('Octavia Butler', 'Kindred', 'Doubleday', '1979-06-01'),
('N.K. Jemisin', 'How Long \'til Black Future Month', 'Orbit', '2018-11-27');
```

The only slight error I encountered was accidentally typing a . instead of a , on
one of the lines -- it happens to the best of us.

> NOTE: I deleted the entries from last week because why not and noticed that this
  didn't change the accession numbers existing records. I assume that because the MySQL
  code automatically assigning a # is a one-time event, it doesn't go back and retroactively
  sift through the database to see if 1 or 2 or 3 still exists. I thought about changing
  the ID#s, but I realized that future records would create a gap starting at 14 and then
  I would just be right back in the same position, and the ID#s don't actually affect my
  ability to find records in my database. An interesting find regardless.

## Conclusion
This was an intriguing week for me. It's really cool to see something that I made
(admittedly out of parts that someone else made, but creating is really recreating,
right?) actually function and that any of the problems I ran into I was able to 
troubleshoot without issue.

I'm looking forward to employing more sophisticated search apparatuses in the future and
continuing to build the database.
