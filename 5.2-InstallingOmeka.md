# Installing Omeka
There were a ton of steps for this week, and it required pulling together a lot of knowledge from throughout the semester.
To help organize my thoughts, I figured that the best course of action was to break down the big task of "install and configure Omeka"
into three smaller, more manageable tasks.

>NOTE: I didn't add prerequisites to my list of steps here (even though I did them) because that was simply following inputting the stated commands.
Here are the three smaller, more manageable tasks with my thoughts on each:

Steps to Install and Configure Omeka:
<details>
<summary>Get the Omeka file</summary>
  
1. Make sure that the `unzip` command is installed: `sudo apt install unzip`
2. Navigate to the correct directory for installation: `cd /var/www/html`
3. Retrieve the zip file from the intenet:
   `sudo wget https://github.com/omeka/Omeka/releases/download/v3.1.2/omeka-3.1.2.zip`
4. Unzip the file to the directory: `sudo unzip omeka 3.1.2.zip`
5. Rename omeka file for convenience: `sudo mv omeka-3.1.2 omeka`

The only problem I encountered here was forgetting to use the `sudo` command a couple of times 
at the beginning of the process. Besides that, all these steps made sense to me.

<details>
<summary>Create a Database for Omeka</summary>

1. Become the root user: `sudo su`
2. Open mysql and create a new Omeka user and give it
   permissions:
   ```
   create user 'omeka'@'localhost' identified by "password";
   create database omeka;
   grant all privileges on omeka.* to 'omeka'@'localhost';
   ```
3. Verify that the database was created successfully: `show databases;`

This step required me going back into module 4 so that I could ensure that I had the proper syntax.
Having identified the correct week, this set of steps was issue free for me (other than a brief
moment where I thought that I forgot my password for the Wordpress database. Luckily I didn't.).

<details>
<summary>Configure Omeka</summary>
  
1. Open the `db.ini` file and configure with correct info:
   ```
   host = "localhost"
   username = "omeka"
   password = "XXXXXXXX"
   prefix = "omeka_"
   charset = "utf8"
   ;port = ""
   ```
2. Change ownership of files so that data can be stored and written:
   ```
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/omeka/files
   ```
3. Finish the set-up process in the browser:
   Go to the webpage @ http://34.68.163.240/omeka/
   and finish setting it up
4. OPTIONAL: Upload a photo and apply tags and information

I initially had a hard time finding the `db.ini` file because I didn't
see it on the main page and went hunting through the different subdirectories of `omeka`
for about 20 minutes before realizing that it was on the main `omeka` page \*facepalm*.

Aside from that embarassing waste of time, I didn't encounter any difficulties with configuring
Omeka and finishing the set up process in browser. I like the configuration document for Omeka
much more than Wordpress because it feels more intuitive than the big `php` file that Wordpress 
used.

This was a good test of all the commands and procedures we've been working with, and I'm happy to say that I
could follow what we were doing and, more importantly, why we were doing everything. It is really amazing to 
me how all this stuff fits together to create websites on the internet, and I've certainly gained a lot of insight
and appreciation for web masters and administrators everywhere over the last couple of weeks. I wonder if LFPL's
website master has to deal with all this backend stuff in the command line or if he's using a GUI?
